# Dark Google Colab Stylus Theme

Dark Google Colab Theme for Stylus Chrome Extension

# Installation 

First install Stylus Chrome Extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne

Download the JSON file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MihaTomsic/DarkGoogleColabStylusTheme/master/DarkGoogleColabStylusTheme.json

and import it into Stylus.

# Future work

Scrollbars ...

Output messages might be a problem because style is hardcoded into the HTML elements. AFAIK Stylus does not support altering element style.

Error messages are particulary dark (red, blue) so it's sometimes hard to read.

Clearer and more structured code would improve readability but my first goal is functional code.

I am not a CSS expert but I have done some funky CSS in the past.
