# Dark Google Colab Stylus Theme

Dark Google Colab Theme for Stylus Chrome Extension

# Installation 

First install Stylus Chrome Extension from https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne

Download the JSON file: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MihaTomsic/DarkGoogleColabStylusTheme/master/DarkGoogleColabStylusTheme.json

and import it into Stylus.

# Future work

Menus, scrollbars, active/passive gutters ...

Clearer and more structured code would improve readability but my first goal is functional code.

# Disclaimer

I am not a CSS expert but I have done some funky CSS in the past.
